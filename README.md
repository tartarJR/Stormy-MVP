# Stormy-MVP

I followed the Android Beginner Course on Treehouse and i am trying to improve their app by adding new features like dynamic location, showing more currrentWeather data etc. I am also trying to implement a MVP architecture and improving code readability and code reuse for more clean structure.

Some of the code content and copyrights might belong to Treehouse.
